# And here is the content of my first blog...

## Welcome to our technology website! {#welcome-to-our-technology-website}
We have been working in the Data Science industry for 15 years and are now the biggest pure player in Europe with 250+ data profiles. We have been benefiting from the open source community for a while, and we want to give back to the community by sharing insights on what we've learned over the years:
- [Blog](/blog) - read articles on various Data topics: from industrialization on cloud platforms to exotic Deep Learning algorithms
<!-- - [Best practices & convictions](/docs) - discover our programming best practices, our tech convictions and preferred technologies -->
- [Open source contributions](/opensource) - browse our own open source contributions (Python libraries, code snippets)

ðŸ’Œ After reading behind the scenes of the Data Science Company, feel free to [send us a email](mailto:inno@ekimetrics.com) for any questions or feedbacks!
