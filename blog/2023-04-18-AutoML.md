Towards Data Science - Title: AutoML for time series: definitely a good idea
Mikhail Sarafanov - June 26th, 2021

===============================

Manage pipe of several ML operations:
 - MLFlow, https://mlflow.org/ ;
 - Apache AirFlow, https://airflow.apache.org/ ;


Generate pipeline in an automatic way, open source frameworks/libraries: 
 - TPOT, http://epistasislab.github.io/tpot/ ;
 - AutoGluon, https://github.com/autogluon/autogluon ;
 - MLJAR, https://github.com/mljar/mljar-supervised ;
 - H2O, https://h2o.ai/ ;


Proprietary SaaS products:
 - DataRobot, https://docs.datarobot.com/en/docs/modeling/index.html ;
 - GoogleAutoTables, https://cloud.google.com/automl-tables/docs?hl=fr ;
 - Amazon SageMaker, https://aws.amazon.com/fr/sagemaker/ ;

---------------

In most cases, the structure of the pipeline is fixed and only hyperparameters are changing.

Some frameworks are able to find a pipeline structure on their own, using evolutionary algorithms; e.g. TPOT, FEDOT (https://github.com/aimclub/FEDOT).

AutoML libraries are specialized for widespread tasks, e.g. classification and regression on tabular data. Less good for text and image processing and time series forecasting.

===============================

# AutoML frameworks specialized in TS forecasting

 - AutoTS framework, 
 - pmdarima library, 

They use classical statistical models such as AR or ARIMA, which are tuned and filtered based on error metric on validation. No new models are generated!!

# Topic at hand: FEDOT
 - FEDOT, https://github.com/aimclub/FEDOT ;

Goal: They would like to solve more than one problem at a time within a single pipeline, e.g. regression & ts forecasting or regression & classification. And they also wanted to investigate methods for identifying pipelines of variable structure and using multi-criteria optimization for the modeling error AND the complexity of the solution.

Towards Data Science - Title: AutoML for time series: advanced approaches with FEDOT framework
Mikhail Sarafanov - June 26th, 2021

===============================

A demonstration of how the evolutionary algorithm of Fedot works, fill-in gaps and ends up with a pipeline to perform a time series forecast.
